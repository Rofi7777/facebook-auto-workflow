## Detailed Design Specification
## Design Specification: Googoogaga Baby Toy Marketing Image

**Product:** Interactive Baby Toy

**Image Goal:** Create an engaging Instagram-style image showcasing the Googoogaga baby toy within a warm, inviting family scene.

**1. Composition & Layout:**

* **Camera Angle:** Slightly elevated, eye-level perspective, looking down gently at the family.
* **Framing:** Square (1024x1024 pixels). The main focus is on the interaction between the baby and the toy, filling approximately 60% of the frame. The family and background occupy the remaining 40%.
* **Focal Points:** The baby's face and their interaction with the toy are the primary focal points. Secondary focal point is the happy family interaction.  Use shallow depth of field to blur the background slightly and draw attention to the baby and toy.


**2. Color Palette (Googoogaga Brand):**

* **Green:** #A7D1AB (Soft, calming green)
* **Red:** #E67E22 (Warm, playful red – similar to burnt orange)
* **Yellow:** #FFD700 (Bright, cheerful yellow – classic yellow)
* **Gray:** #D3D3D3 (Light gray, used for subtle background elements and for softening other colors)
* **Orange:** #F59F5C (A warm, muted orange to complement the red and yellow)


**3. Lighting Setup:**

* **Natural Light:** Primarily soft, diffused natural light from a large window to the side and slightly behind the family.  Avoid harsh shadows.
* **Direction:**  Light should come from a 45-degree angle, creating a gentle highlight on the baby's face and the toy.
* **Intensity:** Soft and even; avoid overexposed areas.


**4. Object Placement & Proportions:**

* **Toy:** Strategically placed in the center-slightly-left of the frame, where the baby is interacting with it.  The toy should be prominently displayed but not overpowering the baby.
* **Baby:**  Sitting or lying on a soft blanket, comfortably engaging with the toy. The toy should be appropriately sized for a baby's hands.


**5. Background & Environment Details:**

* **Setting:** A bright, airy living room with natural elements like a wooden floor, a comfortable rug in shades of gray and beige (#D3D3D3, #F5F5DC).  Potted plants with green (#A7D1AB) foliage are in the background, adding to the natural and welcoming atmosphere.  Minimal clutter.
* **Texture:**  Soft textures are emphasized – the baby's blanket, the rug, possibly a wooden toy shelf.


**6. Human Subjects:**

* **Age:** Baby aged 6-12 months.
* **Expressions:** Baby displaying genuine happiness and engagement with the toy. Parents displaying warm smiles and affectionate interactions with the baby.
* **Clothing:** Soft, neutral-toned clothing (pale creams, light grays, perhaps a touch of the brand's accent colors as small details).  Avoid bold patterns or logos.
* **Poses:** Natural, candid poses.  Parents should be interacting with the baby and the toy, perhaps gently assisting the baby's play.


**7. Typography & Text Overlay Suggestions:**

* **Font:** A clean, modern sans-serif font (e.g., Open Sans, Lato).
* **Text:**  Consider short, engaging phrases like "Googoogaga: Spark Joy," or "Happy Baby, Happy Moments," or simply the brand logo and a small tagline.  Place text in a corner with a semi-transparent background for readability.


**8. Brand Elements Integration:**

* **Logo:**  Googoogaga logo subtly placed in a corner (bottom right preferred), maintaining a consistent brand identity.
* **Slogan:** (Optional) A short and memorable slogan could be placed near the logo.


**9. Technical Specs:**

* **Resolution:** 1024x1024 pixels
* **Format:** PNG (for transparency if needed for overlay)


**10. Style References:**

* **Style:** Realistic photography with a soft, slightly desaturated Instagram filter applied to evoke a warm and nostalgic feeling.  Avoid overly stylized or artificial lighting.  Aim for a style similar to popular baby product photography on Instagram.  Reference successful baby product photography on Instagram for inspiration.


**Overall Mood:** Warm, inviting, joyful, natural, authentic, and family-oriented.  The image should communicate the quality and playfulness of the Googoogaga baby toy.
