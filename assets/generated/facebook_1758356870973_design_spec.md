## Detailed Design Specification
## Design Specification: Googoogaga Baby Toy Marketing Image

**1. Product:** Interactive Baby Toy

**2. Image Format:** 16:9 Landscape (1920x1080 pixels, scalable to 1024x1024 PNG for web)


**3. Style:** Realistic photography with a slightly stylized, warm and inviting feel.  Reference images should include works by photographers specializing in lifestyle and family photography with a focus on natural light and soft tones.


**4. Composition and Layout:**

* **Camera Angle:** Slightly elevated, eye-level shot looking down at the family.  The camera should be positioned to capture the interaction naturally without feeling staged.
* **Framing:** Medium shot, focusing on the family's interaction with the toy.  The edges of the frame should leave some breathing room around the subjects.
* **Focal Points:** The primary focal point is the child (approximately 18 months old) happily interacting with the Googoogaga toy. Secondary focal points are the parents' engaged smiles and the overall warm atmosphere of the scene.

**5. Color Palette (Googoogaga Brand):**

* **Green:** #A7D1AB (Soft, natural green – evokes nature and safety)
* **Red:** #E67E22 (Muted, warm red – adds a playful touch)
* **Yellow:** #FFD700 (Soft, sunny yellow – represents joy and learning)
* **Gray:** #D3D3D3 (Light gray – used for subtle background elements and to balance the brighter colors)
* **Orange:** #FF8C00 (Warm orange – accents, used sparingly to highlight specific elements)

**6. Lighting Setup:**

* **Lighting:** Primarily natural soft light from a large window, positioned to the left or right of the frame, creating soft shadows and avoiding harsh contrasts.  A fill light (artificial, softbox) can be used to supplement the natural light and ensure even illumination. The lighting should be warm and inviting (color temperature around 4000-5000K).
* **Direction:** Soft, diffused light from the side, avoiding harsh shadows on the faces.
* **Intensity:** Even and gentle illumination throughout the scene, avoiding overexposed or underexposed areas.

**7. Object Placement and Proportions:**

* **Background:** A softly blurred background showing a comfortable, light-filled living room (see background details below).
* **Toy:** Centrally positioned, but not dominating the scene.  It should be clearly visible and inviting, but the focus should be on the family’s interaction with it.
* **Family:** Parents sit on a rug or comfortable seating slightly offset from center. The child sits or plays in front of them, actively engaging with the toy.

**8. Background and Environment Details:**

* **Setting:** A brightly lit, minimalist living room with neutral-toned walls and soft furnishings (e.g., a cream-colored rug, light-colored sofa partially visible in the background). Natural elements, like a houseplant, can be subtly included to reinforce the natural and safe theme.
* **Details:** The background should be intentionally blurred to keep the focus on the family. Avoid any distracting elements.

**9. Human Subjects:**

* **Child:** Approximately 18 months old, with happy and playful expression. Clothing should be simple and comfortable (e.g., light-colored overalls or a soft sweater).
* **Parents:** Appear happy and engaged, interacting naturally with their child and the toy.  Clothing should be casual and comfortable, complementing the overall warm and friendly atmosphere. (Mother: Light blue shirt; Father: Light gray t-shirt)  Expressions should be warm and genuine, showing positive interaction.


**10. Typography and Text Overlay:**

* **Font:** A clean, friendly sans-serif font like Open Sans or Lato.
* **Text:**  A short, impactful headline (e.g., "Googoogaga: Play, Learn, Grow") and a tagline beneath it (e.g., "Safe & Engaging Toys for Happy Little Ones").
* **Placement:** Text overlay should be placed in a clean area, not obscuring any part of the main image.  Consider placing it subtly at the bottom third of the frame.  Color:  #333333 (Dark Gray)


**11. Brand Elements Integration:**

* **Logo:** The Googoogaga logo should be subtly placed in a corner (bottom right suggested), without obstructing the main image.
* **Slogan:**  (See Typography section).

**12. Technical Specs:**

* **Resolution:** 1920x1080 pixels (master file), scalable to 1024x1024 pixels for web use.
* **Format:** PNG (for transparency if needed for web use).
