## Detailed Design Specification
## Design Specification: Googoogaga Baby Interactive Toy Marketing Image

**1. Product:** Googoogaga Baby Interactive Toy (Specific toy design to be provided separately. This spec assumes a multi-textured, colorful toy suitable for babies 6-12 months)

**2. Overall Style:** Realistic product photography with a clean, bright, and playful aesthetic.  Style reference: High-quality product photography on sites like Amazon or Etsy featuring baby products.


**3. Composition and Layout:**

* **Camera Angle:** Slightly elevated, looking down at the toy at a 30-degree angle.  This provides a clear view of all sides of the toy.
* **Framing:**  The toy occupies approximately 60% of the frame, leaving ample space for text and branding elements.
* **Focal Points:** The main focal point is the toy itself. Secondary focal points are the price and promotional stickers.
* **Rule of Thirds:** The toy should be positioned according to the rule of thirds, slightly off-center for a more visually appealing composition.


**4. Precise Color Palette (Googoogaga Brand):**

* **Green:** #50B564 (A vibrant, slightly desaturated green)
* **Red:** #E84A5F (A bold, slightly muted red)
* **Yellow:** #FFD700 (A classic, bright yellow)
* **Grey:** #C0C0C0 (A light, neutral grey for background elements)
* **Orange:** #FF8C00 (A rich, warm orange)  These colors should be present on the toy itself.


**5. Lighting Setup:**

* **Artificial Lighting:**  Softbox lighting is preferred to minimize harsh shadows and create even illumination.
* **Direction:** Two softboxes positioned at approximately 45-degree angles to the toy, one on each side.
* **Intensity:**  Bright, but not overly saturated; the goal is to showcase the toy’s textures and colors accurately.  Avoid any harsh highlights or reflections.


**6. Object Placement and Proportions:**

* **Toy Placement:** Centrally located within the frame, slightly off-center according to the rule of thirds.
* **Proportions:** The toy should occupy a significant portion of the frame, but not overwhelm it.  The surrounding space should be used effectively for text and branding.


**7. Background and Environment Details:**

* **Background:** Pure white (#FFFFFF) cyclorama background for a clean and uncluttered look.
* **Environment:** No additional props or elements are needed.  The focus should be solely on the toy.


**8. Human Subjects:**

* **None:** This image focuses solely on the product.


**9. Typography and Text Overlay Suggestions:**

* **Font:**  A clean, modern sans-serif font like Open Sans or Lato.
* **Text Elements:**
    * **Product Name:** (e.g., "Googoogaga Sensory Cube") - Large, bold font.
    * **Price:** (e.g., "$29.99") - Clear, easily readable font.  Consider using a contrasting color (e.g., red) for price.
    * **Promotional Sticker:** (e.g., "20% OFF," "Limited Time Offer") - Bold font, potentially using a vibrant color.
* **Text Placement:**  Price and promotional stickers should be placed near the toy, but not obstructing it.  Product name can be placed below the product or slightly above it.


**10. Brand Elements Integration:**

* **Logo:**  Googoogaga logo (to be provided) should be placed discreetly in a corner (bottom right is suggested), maintaining brand consistency.
* **Slogan:** (if applicable)  A short and memorable slogan can be added below the logo.
